      On Neutrinos: Eric Weinstein brought up neutrinos in a talk recently, quipping that we should be glad we can&rsquo;t feel neutrinos in this space &ldquo;because they&rsquo;re tearing through all of us body and soul.&rdquo; Ironically, he was defending Brian Green and String Theory when he made this remark - pointing out that there is still a lot we don&rsquo;t understand of subatomic particles. This is ironic, by the way, because Eric is known for being very critical of string theory and the scientists behind the long-running scientific effort.

      On Descartes: I&rsquo;m reading Descartes&rsquo; Discourse on Method and Meditations on First Philosophy and I didn&rsquo;t know that it was mostly a defense of theism! I&rsquo;m not sure what I was expencting, as I only really knew that he was very influential, but I was surprised that this is the focus of the text. Now, I only recently started the book but because it is so short I&rsquo;m already about half-way through it and I have some thoughts on it already&hellip;

      On the Future: &ldquo;We Wanted Flying Cars, Instead We Got 140 Characters.&rdquo; This is a famous Peter Thiel quote that I think perfectly encapsulates his views on the current state of technology and innovation in the world. The argument is a simple yet powerful one: we&rsquo;ve falling behind in technological progress. Half a century ago, people thought we would have flying cars by now, instead our only innovation has essentially come in the form of 0s and 1s, mostly related to or for the benefit of internet technologies.

      On Acceleration: Am I an accelerationist? Most likely. I gotta be honest though, I haven&rsquo;t really looked into the term very carefully. However, I think the term is pretty self-explanatory, so I will use it here the way I&rsquo;ve heard it used lately. I believe that we should not be slowing down technological progress at almost any cost. The technological progress I&rsquo;m talking about includes, progress in Energy, Medicine, Transportation, and Space Travel.

      On Energy: We need better sources of energy. I&rsquo;m glad to know Biden&rsquo;s agenda considers this an important issue. The president&rsquo;s Build Back Better plan, which also focuses on building, and the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act are good signs that the US government is taking some action on energy. Hopefully we can embrace this kind of movement regadless of what polical party is in office, because for the country to be able to defend its ideals of democracy and liberty, to fight climate change, and to solve important issues at home, it needs to not only have a strong economy but it also needs to build faster.

      On Finding Other Homes in the Solar System: Elon Musk is right. We do need to make sure we have humans living in other places other than earth at some point in the future. As many people have argued before, from Physicists to Science Fiction writers and those in between, such as Eric Weinstein and Musk, we need a plan B in case something goes wrong on earth. We need to preserve human life and the precious consciousness we are familiar with.

      On Building: &ldquo;To build&rdquo; is my current motto, or guiding principle. It is probably best summarized by Marc Andreessen&rsquo;s &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Time to Build&rdquo; essay, where he argues that our focus should be on building. I also think this is the best thing we can do right now to ensure a good future awaits us. And while I do think other things are important, such as tearing down oppresive systems and taking care of those in need, we are in urgent need of more building.

      Tuesday Night: &ldquo;Erica Albright is a bitch. Do you think that&rsquo;s because her family changed their name from Albrecht or do you think it&rsquo;s because all BU girls are bitches? For the record, she may look like 34C but she&rsquo;s getting all kinds of help from our friends at Victoria&rsquo;s Secret. She&rsquo;s a 34B, as in barely anything there. False advertising.
The truth is she has a nice face. I need to do something to take my mind off her.

      Thoughts: I&rsquo;m not sure how I&rsquo;m going to name my new posts. Should I commit to simply numbering them forever? Or should I try to give each one a thoughtful title? Maybe I should only do that with longer posts&hellip; I would have to label them somehow though. When I cross that bridge!
