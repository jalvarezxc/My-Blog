<p>I&rsquo;m reading Descartes&rsquo; <em>Discourse on Method and Meditations on First Philosophy</em> and I didn&rsquo;t know that it was mostly a defense of theism! I&rsquo;m not sure what I was expencting, as I only really knew that he was very influential, but I was surprised that this is the focus of the text. Now, I only recently started the book but because it is so short I&rsquo;m already about half-way through it and I have some thoughts on it already&hellip;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but think of all the things we know now that make his arguments harder to accept. For intance, I think that with all the advances in Neuroscience and Articial Intelligence, it has become easier to accept that the mind is simply a result of the brain&rsquo;s complexity. I mean, now that computers can pass the Turing test and are capable of having conversations with us, it&rsquo;s not hard to imagine that soon enough we won&rsquo;t be able to distingish between a real mind and an artificial one.</p>
<p>For this reason and because of my bias against theism I&rsquo;m struggling to enjoy his work so far unfortunately. But, who knows maybe I&rsquo;ll end up enjoying the book overall once I finish it! I will give an update in a future post.</p>
